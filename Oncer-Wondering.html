    <h3>Color Receptors:
    </h3>
    <p> 
    Humanity keeps trying to adapt to this new environment, humans as many other animals have color receptors which allos us to see the world in color. This magnecficent tool has been helping the Human race to discover, develop, and grow into their environment as big as they can. we are all reallly dependent to our sight making it really important for us humans to have this sence and connect with Our environment that way.

    <h3>Cone cells:</h3>
    <p>One of the photoreceptors in the retina of the eye that is responsible for daylight and color vision; they are densely concentrated in the fovea centralis, creating the area of greatest visual acuity. Also called cone, retinal cone. (This is the defenition acoording to: Dictionary.com)
    
    </p>
    
    <p> In other words a receptor (photo-type) that helps us see colors, Usually localized on the greatest visual activities area (which makes us concentrate on them much more than any thing else)  </p>

    <h2>Color vision test:</h2>
    <p>How many different color shades can you see?  </p>
      
    <img class="img-responsive center"   src="http://www.snopes.com/politics/graphics/tetrachromacy.jpg"
         linkalt="Color Test" width="500" height="300">
    
    
    <p>If you are able to see between 20 to 32 shades of color, then you are considered:trichromat(which means that you have 3 different types of cones). </p>
    
    <p>But, if you can see between 33 to 39 colors, then you are considered:tetrachromat(which means that you have 4 different types of cones).</p>
   <p> Note: only 25% of the population has this state.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Note:Don't believe your score right now because computer screens aren't capable to proudly create the different color dimensions that the actual test will reveal for the tetrachromats.</strong> </p>
